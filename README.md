### Introduction

- CEO of AquaAge Inc. 
- Ph.D. Candidate in Informatics at Nagoya University   

My research interest is modeling personalized driving styles for autonomous driving. During my PhD course, I first model subjective risk levels for individuals, and I will implement a Human-in-the-Loop prototype for personalized data-driven control to combine learning based risk models with model predictive control.

#### I am having fun of Coursera courses.

- Having so much fun during this 'deeplearning.ai' specialization course in Coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. Such a good course organized on gaining an intuitive understanding of recurrent and convolutional neural networks including attention mechanism, transfer learning ideas. Handy programming practice such as neural machine translation, facial recognition helped me observe more details on implementation. Highly recommended course.

- Introduction to Self-driving Cars

It takes me several months to finish this self-driving introduction course, but it's totally worth it. Now I have an overview of how self-driving cars being conducted. I still need a lot to explore in this field.

- State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars.
In this course, I've learned many knowledge in state estimation such as using several Kalman filters to localize the surrounding vehiles using Lidar and GNSS information. I still have many unknown topic in this field, but I think I had a very general idea about state estimation and localization, which are crucial for autonoumous driving technoledges .

- Some simple project work 

* Build a Google Firebase Web Application.
I have a project to learn how to use Firebase to generate WebApp and AndroidApp using JS and HTML. It was a fun course.
